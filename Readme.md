## Parts

### Front Sight
 - Red part is bored for a 3BA grub screw.
 - Blue part is bored for an M4 grub screw.

3BA is probably the correct size based on the fact the sterling was British manufactured and compared to the reference images.

Unfortunately 3BA seems to be hard to find in a grub screw and 2BA is too big and 4BA looks too small compared to the reference.

**My preference is to use an M4 grub screw into the 3BA part.  This threads nicely and doesn't force the plastic too much as the hole is slightly larger.**

Also included in the file is a base block with no grub screw hole or pin hole and one with just the pin hole for anyone wanting to customise this part.

### Front Sight Pin
Has the correct outside bore as the thread.  Thread was left off as it wouldn't print well enough so small.  Groove is added for the grub screw used for alignment.

### End Clip
Sized to match the aluminium channel supplied in the T-Jay kit.  Slightly adjusted from true dimensions but nothing drastic.  Will need the knurling added after printing.

### Stock Cube
Designed to fit *my* blaster moulding but should fit most if carved out accordingly.  12mm square on a side.  The correct size would be imperial, probably 1/2".

A 8mm diameter stub is added to aid gluing to the tube in the T-Jay kit.

### Power Cylinder
These have been modeled based on the only measurements I could find, by Playfulwolfcub.  The author makes highly researched and regarded metal replicas.

The v1.0 part was compared with a metal replica of one of their parts and a few small adjustments made to closer match the replica.

The v1.1 is also available in 3 of the profiles seen in the films.
